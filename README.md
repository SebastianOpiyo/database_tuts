# Database_tuts
All about database, SQL etc

Everything I have learned about database. All the code I have saved here for reference.
What to find in what file is also briefly described in here.

## BASICS
I started with a basic table that is detailed in the basicsql.sql file

## COMPLEX
Then I moved to something more than trivial. There is more than one table in the company database
contained in the complexdbatable.sql
